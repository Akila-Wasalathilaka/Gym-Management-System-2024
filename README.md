### Next Steps for the Interfaces:

1. **Login Interface**:
   - Build a secure login system for both gym staff and members. For staff, restrict access to management features (like member and payment management).
   
2. **Member Management Interface**:
   - Create forms to add, update, and delete member information (name, contact info, membership status, etc.).

3. **Class Scheduling Interface**:
   - Implement a scheduling system to manage gym classes (e.g., time, type, instructor). Use calendars or tables for displaying schedules.

4. **Payment Interface**:
   - Create a form for collecting payment details (credit card, billing address, etc.). Integrate it with payment gateways for processing.

5. **Home Dashboard Interface**:
   - Design a dashboard that shows a summary of gym operations, such as active memberships, upcoming classes, and payment statuses.
